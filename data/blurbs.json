Desirable locations near public transit and neighborhood centers are especially under-zoned, stifling business and inflating housing prices by preventing supply from meeting demand.,",
  "solution-zoning-text-p2": "We support zoning reforms such as [[LINK_START, https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2019.1651216]] eliminating single-family zoning[[LINK_END]] city-wide and allowing taller and denser [[LINK_START, https://nlihc.org/resource/california-passes-bill-streamline-affordable-housing-production-commercial-zones]]housing in commercial areas[[LINK_END]] and near transit hubs.",
